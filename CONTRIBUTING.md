### Opening an Issue

When reporting a bug or requesting a feature, please include the following information to help us understand and address your issue quickly:

#### For Bug Reports

1. **Clear title** - Summarize the issue in one line
2. **Description** - Explain what's happening and what you expected to happen

   3. Scroll down to '...'
   4. See error
   ```
4. **Environment details**:
   - **OS**: (e.g., macOS 14.2, Windows 11, Ubuntu 22.04)
   - **Node version**: (run `node --version`)
   - **Package manager**: (pnpm, npm, yarn) and version
   - **Browser**: (if widget-related - e.g., Chrome 120, Firefox 121, Safari 17)
   - **Package versions**: List relevant `@contextcompany/*` package versions
   - **Framework**: (e.g., Next.js 14.1.0, if applicable)
5. **Code snippets** - Share minimal code that reproduces the issue
6. **Screenshots/recordings** - If applicable, visual aids are very helpful
7. **Error messages** - Include full error messages and stack traces
8. **Additional context** - Any other relevant information (e.g., "works in development but not production")

#### For Feature Requests

1. **Clear title** - Summarize the feature
2. **Problem statement** - Describe the problem this feature would solve
3. **Proposed solution** - How you envision this working
4. **Alternatives considered** - Other approaches you've thought about
5. **Additional context** - Use cases, examples, or references to similar implementations

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/observatory.git
   cd observatory
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/The-Context-Company/observatory.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## Project Structure

Observatory is a **pnpm monorepo** with the following structure:

```
observatory/
├── packages/
│   ├── otel/     # @contextcompany/otel - OpenTelemetry integration
│   └── widget/   # @contextcompany/widget - Preact widget for Local Mode
└── examples/     # Examples of Local Mode
```

### Package Descriptions

#### `@contextcompany/otel`

OpenTelemetry instrumentation layer for the Vercel AI SDK. Provides span processors, exporters, and Next.js integration for collecting telemetry data in both local and cloud modes.

#### `@contextcompany/widget`

Browser-based visualization widget for real-time AI SDK observability. Built with Preact for minimal bundle size and uses Shadow DOM for style isolation.

## Submitting changes

### Development workflow

1. Fork the repo (see [Initial Setup](#initial-setup))
2. Create a feature branch

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-name/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Commit and push to your changes
4. Open a pull request
   - please check `Allow edits from maintainers` so we can make small tweaks before merging!

### Helper package scripts

Each package supports two development modes:

#### `pnpm dev`

- **Watch mode only** - Automatically rebuilds when you save files
- Output goes to the `dist/` folder

#### `pnpm dev:all`

- **Watch mode + local HTTP server**
- Automatically rebuilds AND serves the built files on port 3001 or 3002
- Lets you use URL imports for testing your local changes outside of the workspace

## Testing

We don't yet have a comprehensive test suite (contributions welcome!). Please manually test your changes:

1. **Build the packages** you modified
2. **Run the example app** to verify functionality
3. **Test both local and cloud modes** if applicable

If you're adding a new feature, consider adding test cases or documenting test procedures in your PR.

## Commit Message Conventions

We recommend the conventional commit format:

`<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Examples:**

```
feat(otel): add support for custom span attributes
fix(widget): resolve drag-and-drop positioning bug
docs: update installation instructions
chore: upgrade dependencies
```

**Happy contributing!** We appreciate your time and effort in making The Context Company better for everyone.
