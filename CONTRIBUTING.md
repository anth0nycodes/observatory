### Initial Setup

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/observatory.git
   cd observatory
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/The-Context-Company/observatory.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

## Project Structure

Observatory is a **pnpm monorepo** with the following structure:

```

### Package Descriptions

#### `@contextcompany/otel`

OpenTelemetry instrumentation layer for the Vercel AI SDK. Provides span processors, exporters, and Next.js integration for collecting telemetry data in both local and cloud modes.

**Key files:**

- `src/TCCSpanProcessor.ts` - Filters and processes AI SDK spans
- `src/nextjs/instrumentation.ts` - Main API (`registerOTelTCC()`)
- `src/nextjs/local/` - Local mode WebSocket server
- `src/exporters/` - Custom OTLP exporters

#### `@contextcompany/widget`

Browser-based visualization widget for real-time AI SDK observability. Built with Preact for minimal bundle size and uses Shadow DOM for style isolation.

**Key files:**

- `src/widget.tsx` - Main widget UI
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/state.ts` - Global state management with Preact signals

## Development Workflow

### Working on a Package

1. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-name/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Navigate to the package** you want to work on:

   ```bash
   cd packages/<package-name>
   ```

### Understanding Development Commands

Each package supports two development modes:

#### `pnpm dev`

- **Watch mode only** - Automatically rebuilds when you save files
- Output goes to the `dist/` folder
- **No local server included**
- Faster and minimal overhead

#### `pnpm dev:all`

- **Watch mode + local HTTP server**
- Automatically rebuilds AND serves the built files
- Each package may serve on a different port (check package-specific documentation)
- Ideal for developing browser-loadable scripts or debugging package outputs directly

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Working on a package with testing via example app
cd packages/otel
pnpm dev                    # Terminal 1: Watch and rebuild

cd examples/nextjs-widget
pnpm dev                    # Terminal 2: Run consumer app
```

Or:

```bash
# Working on a package with direct browser testing
cd packages/widget
pnpm dev:all               # Watches, rebuilds, and serves on localhost
```

### Testing Your Changes

You can test your changes in the example app:

```bash
cd examples/nextjs-widget
pnpm dev  # Starts Next.js on http://localhost:3000
```

The example app uses the local packages via workspace dependencies, so your changes will be reflected after rebuilding.

### Building

Build individual packages:

```bash
cd packages/otel
pnpm build
```

Build all packages from the root:

```bash
pnpm build
```

**Note:** The widget package requires CSS compilation. Run `pnpm build:css` first or use `pnpm dev` for watch mode.

### Adding Dependencies

When adding dependencies to a package:

1. Navigate to the package directory
2. Add the dependency:

   ```bash
   pnpm add <package-name>
   # or for dev dependencies
   pnpm add -D <package-name>
   ```

3. Rebuild the package to ensure everything works

For cross-package dependencies (e.g., using `@contextcompany/otel` in an example), use workspace protocol:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@contextcompany/otel": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

## Testing

Currently, Observatory does not have a comprehensive test suite (contributions welcome!). Please manually test your changes:

1. **Build the packages** you modified
2. **Run the example app** to verify functionality
3. **Test both local and cloud modes** if applicable
4. **Check for console errors** and warnings
5. **Test in different browsers** if working on the widget

If you're adding a new feature, consider adding test cases or documenting test procedures in your PR.

## Submitting Changes

### Opening a Pull Request

1. **Push your branch** to your fork:

2. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub from your fork to `The-Context-Company/observatory:main`

3. **Fill out the PR template** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Motivation and context
   - How you tested the changes
   - Screenshots/videos if applicable (especially for widget changes)
   - Any breaking changes or migration steps

4. **Use a descriptive PR title** following the [Commit Message Conventions](#commit-message-conventions)

5. **Link related issues if applicable** using keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456"

### PR Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes
- Address feedback by pushing additional commits to your branch
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
- Your changes will be included in the next release

## Commit Message Conventions

While not strictly enforced, we recommend following conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation changes
- `style` - Code style/formatting
- `refactor` - Code refactoring
- `test` - Adding/updating tests
- `chore` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```
feat(otel): add support for custom span attributes
fix(widget): resolve drag-and-drop positioning bug
docs: update installation instructions
chore: upgrade dependencies
```

## Review Process

### What We Look For

- **Correctness** - Does the code work as intended?
- **Code quality** - Is it readable, maintainable, and well-structured?
- **Performance** - Are there any performance concerns?
- **Security** - Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- **Testing** - Has it been adequately tested?
- **Documentation** - Are changes documented appropriately?

### Review Timeline

- We aim to provide initial feedback within **3-5 business days**
- Complex changes may take longer
- Feel free to ping maintainers if your PR hasn't been reviewed after a week

### Addressing Feedback

- Be open to constructive criticism
- Ask questions if feedback is unclear
- Push additional commits to address comments
- Mark conversations as resolved once addressed

## Community
